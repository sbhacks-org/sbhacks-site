		<div>
			SB Hacks is a 36-hour hackathon hosted annually by students at University of California, Santa Barbara. Normally the event takes place on campus, but this year, we are going digital!
			<br>
			We invite college students from different backgrounds to come together to build, design, and simply “hack” together projects for a remarkable weekend. There will be several fun activities, from workshops to tech talks, as well as prizes and opportunities to connect with industry mentors.
			<br>
			SB Hacks aims to expose college students to the technology industry and provide the necessary resources to get hands-on experience in coding. Whether you are a first-time coder or a seasoned hacker, we encourage you to enter SB Hacks with enthusiasm and curiosity. Our hope is that you challenge yourself with a fun project, learn something new along the way, and are proud of what you have accomplished at the end of it all.
